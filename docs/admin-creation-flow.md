# Admin User Creation Flow

## Overview
The CreateAdminModal provides three different methods for setting up new admin users, each with different password handling approaches.

## Password Setup Methods

### 1. Email Invitation (Recommended) üöÄ
**Best for:** Most secure and user-friendly approach

**Flow:**
1. Admin fills out form (email, name, role) 
2. System creates user account with `email_confirm: false`
3. Secure invitation token generated
4. Invitation email sent with setup link
5. New admin clicks link ‚Üí password setup page
6. They create password and complete profile
7. Account becomes active

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Supabase Auth Admin API
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: userData.email,
  email_confirm: false,
  user_metadata: { 
    full_name: userData.name,
    invited_by: currentAdmin.id,
    role_id: userData.roleId
  }
});

// Generate invitation token and send email
```

### 2. Temporary Password üîê
**Best for:** When immediate access is needed

**Flow:**
1. Admin fills out form
2. System generates secure 12-character password
3. User account created with temporary password
4. Email sent with login credentials
5. New admin logs in with temp password
6. System forces password change on first login

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: userData.email,
  password: userData.temporaryPassword,
  email_confirm: true,
  user_metadata: { 
    must_change_password: true,
    full_name: userData.name
  }
});
```

### 3. Set Initial Password üîë
**Best for:** When admin wants control over initial password

**Flow:**
1. Admin sets initial password in form
2. User account created with that password
3. Credentials sent to new admin
4. New admin can login immediately
5. Password change optional

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: userData.email,
  password: userData.temporaryPassword,
  email_confirm: true,
  user_metadata: { 
    full_name: userData.name
  }
});
```

## Complete Implementation Steps

### Backend Requirements
1. **Supabase Edge Function** for user creation (bypasses RLS)
2. **Email templates** for invitations and credentials
3. **Invitation token system** for secure setup links
4. **Profile creation** with role assignment

### Frontend Components
- ‚úÖ `CreateAdminModal` - Complete form with all password methods
- ‚úÖ `RoleDelegationCard` - Integration with create button
- ‚úÖ Form validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Password generation and preview

### Security Considerations
- **Invitation tokens** expire after 24 hours
- **Temporary passwords** are cryptographically secure
- **Email verification** required for invitation method
- **Force password change** for temporary passwords
- **Audit logging** for admin creation actions

## UI Features

### Form Fields
- Email address (with validation)
- Full name
- Role selection (admin-type roles only)
- Password method selection (radio buttons)
- Dynamic password fields based on method
- Send notification checkbox

### Password Method UI
- **Invitation**: Clean explanation, no password field
- **Temporary**: Shows generated password with regenerate option
- **Set Password**: Password input with strength requirements

### Validation
- Email format validation
- Required field validation
- Password strength requirements (8+ chars for manual)
- Role selection required

## Email Templates Needed
